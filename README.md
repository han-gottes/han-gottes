### Hey, I'm HannahðŸ‘‹

`fish ecologist & data manager`

I like using cross-disciplinary approaches to answer complex questions about marine fish species' resilience. Right now, I'm studying gag (*Mycteroperca microlepis*) space use & population genetics for my PhD with the [MERR](https://github.com/movement-ecology-repro-resilience) lab. I also handle data uploads & quality control for the [iTAG](https://github.com/iTAG-node) telemetry network. When I'm not in front of my screens, you can find on the water or in the woods.
